I am looking for someone  to put together a website actually a dapp where all people 
 can list their ideas as to what they want to see on a list of demands that will be 
put to the tyrannical government. The goal is to create a free transparent accessible 
place where the regular people left and right can come together and have a voice at the table.
 This I believe will be a powerful tool.. The issue that often happens is only a few people
 put together the demands like when they ask the Canadian truckers for demands they said end 
mandates and had a number of people against it since they confirmed and it effected them little . 
The ending of mandates alone didn’t solve how they got there in the first place and giving those that 
conformed the option to add what is an issue for them to demands you take away the tool of division 
that is often used. amany feel left out or don’t really have conviction over it. When not directly 
involved and this would be that on-ramp We don’t want just no mandates how about term limits 
end lobbying and more as I am in America and it’s going to come to citizens taking up their 
guns here soon if not coming together . We have a trucker convoy that has started but it will 
not work because the change will be insignificant and many won’t support them because they 
wave trump flags. However when the demands are of a shared nature you may see the unthinkable 
and democrats and republicans together  This will only happen when the number of people involved 
is large and loud enough and transcends political affiliation.I want the number of people that feel 
it’s their cause to support   these demands to be the shared voice of  the whole damn country 
should even eliminate the divide these assholes use against us by everyone having a seat at the table.
 Just looking for a dapp that you can list your proposed demands in number fashion and keeps track of 
key words such as term limits to put in order of most popular ideas. Don’t want prewritten ideas as that 
limits people. Most importantly can have no political stuff some people are doing this but they are 
political and that is the divider in itself . A little change won’t cut it we need to transform this together .
 Feedback please looking for help working with and trying to get developers that can help to help make it nonhackable 
transparent free and accessible and then can maybe be a tool that is copied and adjusted and used by other people in other countries.
 We all have been lacking the ability to come together one place to make unshakable universal demands that are of the entire  people.
 The tyrannical government lost the ability to speak for us so let’s unite our voices and speak for ourselves.
 Don't want credit for anything if you make it tell me where to access it and spread the word where to go. Would be good 
To have one for Canadians Americans and all the countries that need
And haven't found a place not political
To add our voice into the pot
