I am looking for someone to put together a website, actually a dapp where all people 
 can list their ideas as to what they want to see, a list of demands that will be 
put to the tyrannical government. The goal is to create a free transparent accessible 
place where the regular people both left and right can come together and have a voice at the table.
 This I believe will be a powerful tool. The issue that often happens is only a few people
 put together the demands when the opportunity rises an example is the Canadian truckers they stood to end
mandates and had a number of people against it since they conformed to the mandate it didn't have an effect on their lives. 
The ending of mandates alone didn’t solve how they got there in the first place however and by giving those that 
conformed the option to add what is an issue for them to the demands we can take away the tool of division  
that is often used and grow the strength of the people. So that we may not loose the rare opportunity in which people have been pushed to this 
to effect the change that's necessary. We don’t want just no mandates how about; term limits, 
end lobbying, fair tax code and many more things that are necessary to stop the corruption and manipulation that we live under today . 
The possibilities are actually endless when we come together and we can remove the limits which we put upon ourselves. The country is ours and we control the government 
But have forgotten that. I am in America and it’s going to come to citizen's taking up their 
guns here soon if not coming together. We have a trucker convoy that has started but it will 
not work because the change will be insignificant and many won’t support them because they 
wave Trump flags. However when the demands are of a shared nature you may see the unthinkable 
when democrats and republicans come together and when this happens when the number of people involved 
is large and loud enough it will then transcend political affiliation and can not be denied. Turning the voice of few into the entirety is a must. 
This should eliminate the divide these assholes use against us by everyone having a seat at the table.
 Just looking for a dapp that you can list your proposed demands in number fashion and keeps track of 
key words such as term limits to put in order of most popular ideas. Don’t want prewritten ideas as that 
limits people. Most importantly can have no political stuff some people are doing this but they are 
political and that is the divider in itself. A little change won’t cut it we need to transform this together.
 Feedback please looking for help working with and trying to get developers that can help to help make it nonhackable, 
transparent, free and accessible. Then can possibly be a tool that is copied and adjusted to be used by other people in other countries.
 We all have been lacking the ability to come together one place to make unshakable universal demands that are of the entire people.
 The tyrannical government lost the ability to speak for us so let’s unite our voices and speak for ourselves.
 Don't want credit for anything if you make it tell me where to access it and spread the word where to go. Would be good 
To have one for Canadians Americans and all the countries that need
And haven't found a place not political To add our voice into the pot. A simple software program or dapp can help us by having a sole purpose of only focusing 
On actual solutions instead of exploiting the diffences we have to stifle change and preserving the corrupt system. 
We can not expect the criminals of government to police themselves and no longer are they to be trusted to represent the people. 
In America it's taken 200 years to corrupt the government to the point it is today and it will only get worse eliminating the possibility to 
Bring change at some point. We the people can and will change in a short period of time that politicians wouldn't do in a thousand years no matter 
How obviously good for the country it is. Again, the tyrannical governments have lost their ability to speak for the people so we shall speak for ourselves in a 
Unified voice in Which there is no room to drive a wedge and everyone's voice wil be heard.
